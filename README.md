Double click any word to view its definition in a popup bubble

Fork of [Double Click Dict](https://github.com/igorlogius/dbl-click-dict) without Google.

Currently uses Ecosia which uses Oxford dictionary sources. The code is designed to be able to add other possible sources.

Since version 2.0.1, word requests sent from the extension use a custom user-agent that discloses the extension and Firefox revision but won't reveal other client OS info.

**NOTE**: source base URLs will need to be added to the `permissions` key in the manifest.
