Fork of [Double Click Dict](https://github.com/igorlogius/dbl-click-dict) without Google.

Currently uses Ecosia which uses Oxford dictionary sources. The code is designed to be able to add other possible sources.

**NOTE**: source base URLs will need to be added to the `permissions` key in the manifest.
